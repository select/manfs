/boot/grub
    This subdirectory contains the GRUB configuration files including boot-up
    images and sounds. GRUB is the GNU GRand Unified Bootloader, a project
    which intends to solve all bootup problems once and for all. One of the
    most interesting features, is that you don't have to install a new
    partition or kernel, you can change all parameters at boot time via the
    GRUB Console, since it knows about the filesystems.
