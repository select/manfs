1.4. /boot

This directory contains everything required for the boot process except for
configuration files not needed at boot time (the most notable of those being
those that belong to the GRUB boot-loader) and the map installer. Thus, the /
boot directory stores data that is used before the kernel begins executing
user-mode programs. This may include redundant (back-up) master boot records,
sector/system map files, the kernel and other important boot files and data
that is not directly edited by hand. Programs necessary to arrange for the
boot loader to be able to boot a file are placed in /sbin. Configuration
files for boot loaders are placed in /etc. The system kernel is located in
either / or /boot (or as under Debian in /boot but is actually a symbolically
linked at / in accordance with the FSSTND).

/boot/boot.0300
    Backup master boot record.

/boot/boot.b
    This is installed as the basic boot sector. In the case of most modern
    distributions it is actually a symbolic link to one of four files /boot/
    boot-bmp.b, /boot/boot-menu.b, /boot/boot-text.b, /boot/boot-compat.b
    which allow a user to change the boot-up schema so that it utilises a
    splash screen, a simple menu, a text based interface or a minimal boot
    loader to ensure compatibility respectively. In each case re-installation
    of lilo is necessary in order to complete the changes. To change the
    actual 'boot-logo' you can either use utilities such as fblogo or the
    more refined bootsplash.

/boot/chain.b
    Used to boot non-Linux operating systems.

/boot/config-kernel-version
    Installed kernel configuration. This file is most useful when compiling
    kernels on other systems or device modules. Below is a small sample of
    what the contents of the file looks like.

            CONFIG_X86=y
            CONFIG_MICROCODE=m
            CONFIG_X86_MSR=m
            CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION=y
            CONFIG_MTRR=y
            CONFIG_MODULES=y
            CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y
            CONFIG_SCSI_DEBUG=m
            CONFIG_I2O=m
            CONFIG_ARCNET_ETH=y
            CONFIG_FMV18X=m
            CONFIG_HPLAN_PLUS=m
            CONFIG_ETH16I=m
            CONFIG_NE2000=m
            CONFIG_HISAX_HFC_PCI=y
            CONFIG_ISDN_DRV_AVMB1_C4=m
            CONFIG_USB_RIO500=m
            CONFIG_QUOTA=y
            CONFIG_AUTOFS_FS=m
            CONFIG_ADFS_FS=m
            CONFIG_AFFS_FS=m
            CONFIG_HFS_FS=m
            CONFIG_FAT_FS=y
            CONFIG_MSDOS_FS=y
            CONFIG_UMSDOS_FS=m
            CONFIG_FBCON_VGA=m
            CONFIG_FONT_8x8=y
            CONFIG_FONT_8x16=y
            CONFIG_SOUND=m
            CONFIG_SOUND_CMPCI=m
            CONFIG_AEDSP16=m


    As you can see, it's rather simplistic. The line begins with the
    configuration option and whether it's configured as part of the kernel,
    as a module or not at all. Lines beginning with a # symbol are comments
    and are not interpreted during processing.

/boot/os2_d.b
    Used to boot to the 0S/2 operating system.

/boot/map
    Contains the location of the kernel.

/boot/vmlinuz, /boot/vmlinuz-kernel-version
    Normally the kernel or symbolic link to the kernel.

/boot/grub
    This subdirectory contains the GRUB configuration files including boot-up
    images and sounds. GRUB is the GNU GRand Unified Bootloader, a project
    which intends to solve all bootup problems once and for all. One of the
    most interesting features, is that you don't have to install a new
    partition or kernel, you can change all parameters at boot time via the
    GRUB Console, since it knows about the filesystems.

/boot/grub/device.map
    Maps devices in /dev to those used by grub. For example, (/dev/fd0) is
    represented by /dev/fd0 and (hd0, 4) is referenced by /dev/hda5.

/boot/grub/grub.conf, /boot/grub/menu.lst
    Grub configuration file.

/boot/grub/messages
    Grub boot-up welcome message.

/boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz
    Grub boot-up background image.
