1.20. /tmp

  This directory contains mostly files that are required temporarily. Many
programs use this to create lock files and for temporary storage of data. Do
not remove files from this directory unless you know exactly what you are
doing! Many of these files are important for currently running programs and
deleting them may result in a system crash. Usually it won't contain more
than a few KB anyway. On most systems, this directory is cleared out at boot
or at shutdown by the local system. The basis for this was historical
precedent and common practice. However, it was not made a requirement because
system administration is not within the scope of the FSSTND. For this reason
people and programs must not assume that any files or directories in /tmp are
preserved between invocations of the program. The reasoning behind this is
for compliance with IEEE standard P1003.2 (POSIX, part 2).
