1.9. /lib

 The /lib directory contains kernel modules and those shared library images
(the C programming code library) needed to boot the system and run the
commands in the root filesystem, ie. by binaries in /bin and /sbin. Libraries
are readily identifiable through their filename extension of *.so. Windows
equivalent to a shared library would be a DLL (dynamically linked library)
file. They are essential for basic system functionality. Kernel modules
(drivers) are in the subdirectory /lib/modules/'kernel-version'. To ensure
proper module compilation you should ensure that /lib/modules/
'kernel-version'/kernel/build points to /usr/src/'kernel-version' or ensure
that the Makefile knows where the kernel source itself are located.



/lib/'machine-architecture'
    Contains platform/architecture dependent libraries.

/lib/iptables
    iptables shared library files.

/lib/kbd
    Contains various keymaps.

/lib/modules/'kernel-version'
    The home of all the kernel modules. The organisation of files here is
    reasonably clear so no requires no elaboration.

/lib/modules/'kernel-version'/isapnpmap.dep
      has details on ISA based cards, the modules that they require and
    various other attributes.

/lib/modules/'kernel-version'/modules.dep
      lists all modules dependencies. This file can be updated using the
    depmod command.

/lib/modules/'kernel-version'/pcimap
    is the PCI equivalent of the /lib/modules/'kernel-version'/isapnpmap.dep
    file.

/lib/modules/'kernel-version'/usbmap
    is the USB equivalent of the /lib/modules/'kernel-version'/isapnpmap.dep
    file.

/lib/oss
      All OSS (Open Sound System) files are installed here by default.

/lib/security
    PAM library files.



The FSSTND states that the /lib directory contains those shared library
images needed to boot the system and run the commands in the root filesystem,
ie. by binaries in /bin and /sbin.

Shared libraries that are only necessary for binaries in /usr (such as any
X Window binaries) must not be in /lib. Only the shared libraries required
to run binaries in /bin and /sbin may be here. In particular, the library
libm.so.* may also be placed in /usr/lib if it is not required by anything
in /bin or /sbin.

At least one of each of the following filename patterns are required (they
may be files, or symbolic links):

libc.so.* The dynamically-linked C library (optional)
ld*       The execution time linker/loader (optional)

If a C preprocessor is installed, /lib/cpp must be a reference to it, for
historical reasons. The usual placement of this binary is /usr/bin/cpp.

The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, must be in
/lib, if the corresponding subsystem is installed:

modules   Loadable kernel modules (optional)

/lib<qual> : Alternate format essential shared libraries (optional)

There may be one or more variants of the /lib directory on systems which
support more than one binary format requiring separate libraries.

This is commonly used for 64-bit or 32-bit support on systems which support
multiple binary formats, but require libraries of the same name. In this
case, /lib32 and /lib64 might be the library directories, and /lib a symlink
to one of them.

If one or more of these directories exist, the requirements for their contents
are the same as the normal /lib directory, except that /lib<qual>/cpp is
not required.

/lib<qual>/cpp is still permitted: this allows the case where /lib and
/lib<qual> are the same (one is a symbolic link to the other).
