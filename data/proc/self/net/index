    /proc/net/route
        Kernel routing table.

    /proc/net/rpc
          Directory containing rpc info.

    /proc/net/rt_cache
        Routing cache.

    /proc/net/snmp
        SNMP data.

    /proc/net/wireless
          Wireless interface data (Wavelan etc).

    /proc/net/igmp
        IP multicast addresses, which this host joined.

    /proc/net/psched
        Global packet scheduler parameters.

    /proc/net/netlink
        List of PF_NETLINK sockets.

    /proc/net/ip_mr_vifs
        List of multicast virtual interfaces.

    /proc/net/ip_mr_cache

        You can use this information to see which network devices are
        available in your system and how much traffic was routed over those
        devices. In addition, each Channel Bond interface has its own
        directory. For example, the bond0 device will have a directory called
        /proc/net/bond0/. It will contain information that is specific to
        that bond, such as the current slaves of the bond, the link status of
        the slaves, and how many times the slaves link has failed.
