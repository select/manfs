1.16. /sbin

  Linux discriminates between 'normal' executables and those used for system
maintenance and/or administrative tasks. The latter reside either here or -
the less important ones - in /usr/sbin. Locally installed system
administration programs should be placed into /usr/local/sbin.

  Programs executed after /usr is known to be mounted (when there are no
problems) are generally placed into /usr/sbin. This directory contains
binaries that are essential to the working of the system. These include
system administration as well as maintenance and hardware configuration
programs. You may find lilo, fdisk, init, ifconfig, etc.... here.

  Another directory that contains system binaries is /usr/sbin. This
directory contains other binaries of use to the system administrator. This is
where you will find the network daemons for your system along with other
binaries that (generally) only the system administrator has access to, but
which are not required for system maintenance and repair. Normally, these
directories are never part of normal user's $PATHs, only of roots (PATH is an
environment variable that controls the sequence of locations that the system
will attempt to look in for commands).

  The FSSTND states that:



  /sbin should contain only binaries essential for booting, restoring,
  recovering, and/or repairing the system in addition to the binaries
  in /bin.


  A particular eccentricity of the Linux filesystem hierarchy is that
originally /sbin binaries were kept in /etc.


  Deciding what things go into "sbin" directories is simple: if a normal
  (not a system administrator) user will ever run it directly, then it
  must be placed in one of the "bin" directories. Ordinary users should
  not have to place any of the sbin directories in their path.

  For example, files such as chfn which users only occasionally use must
  still be placed in /usr/bin. ping, although it is absolutely necessary
  for root (network recovery and diagnosis) is often used by users and
  must live in /bin for that reason.

  We recommend that users have read and execute permission for everything
  in /sbin except, perhaps, certain setuid and setgid programs. The
  division between /bin and /sbin was not created for security reasons or
  to prevent users from seeing the operating system, but to provide a
  good partition between binaries that everyone uses and ones that are
  primarily used for administration tasks. There is no inherent security
  advantage in making /sbin off-limits for users.


  FSSTND compliance requires that the following commands, or symbolic links
to commands, are required in /sbin.


       shutdown Command to bring the system down.
