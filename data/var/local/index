/var/local
    Variable data for local programs (i.e., programs that have been installed
    by the system administrator) that are installed in /usr/local (as opposed
    to a remotely mounted '/var' partition). Note that even locally installed
    programs should use the other /var directories if they are appropriate,
    e.g., /var/lock.
