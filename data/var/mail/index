/var/mail
    Contains user mailbox files. The mail files take the form /var/mail/
    'username' (Note that /var/mail may be a symbolic link to another
    directory). User mailbox files in this location are stored in the
    standard UNIX mailbox format. The reason for the location of this
    directory was to bring the FHS inline with nearly every UNIX
    implementation (it was previously located in /var/spool/mail). This
    change is important for inter-operability since a single /var/mail is
    often shared between multiple hosts and multiple UNIX implementations
    (despite NFS locking issues).
