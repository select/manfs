/var/log
	Log files from the system and various programs/services, especially login
	(/var/log/wtmp, which logs all logins and logouts into the system) and
	syslog (/var/log/messages, where all kernel and system program message
	are usually stored). Files in /var/log can often grow indefinitely, and
	may require cleaning at regular intervals. Something that is now normally
	managed via log rotation utilities such as 'logrotate'. This utility also
	allows for the automatic rotation compression, removal and mailing of log
	files. Logrotate can be set to handle a log file daily, weekly, monthly
	or when the log file gets to a certain size. Normally, logrotate runs as
	a daily cron job. This is a good place to start troubleshooting general
	technical problems.

/var/log/auth.log
	Record of all logins and logouts by normal users and system processes.

/var/log/btmp
	Log of all attempted bad logins to the system. Accessed via the lastb
	command.

/var/log/debug
	Debugging output from various packages.

/var/log/dmesg
	Kernel ring buffer. The content of this file is referred to by the dmesg
	command.

/var/log/gdm/
	GDM log files. Normally a subset of the last X log file. See /var/log/
	xdm.log for mode details.

/var/log/kdm.log
	KDM log file. Normally a subset of the last X log file. See /var/log/
	xdm.log for more details.

/var/log/messages
	System logs.

/var/log/pacct
	Process accounting is the bookkeeping of process activity. The raw data
	of process activity is maintained here. Three commands can be used to
	access the contents of this file dump-acct, sa (summary of process
	accounting) and lastcomm (list the commands executed on the system).

/var/log/utmp
	Active user sessions. This is a data file and as such it can not be
	viewed normally. A human-readable form can be created via the dump-utmp
	command or through the w, who or users commands.

/var/log/wtmp
	Log of all users who have logged into and out of the system. The last
	command can be used to access a human readable form of this file. It also
	lists every connection and run-level change.

/var/log/xdm.log
	XDM log file. Normally subset of the last X startup log and pretty much
	useless in light of the details the X logs is able to provide us with.
	Only consult this file if you have XDM specific issues otherwise just use
	the X logfile.

/var/log/XFree86.0.log, /var/log/XFree86.?.log
	X startup logfile. An excellent resource for uncovering problems with X
	configuration. Log files are numbered according to when they were last
	used. For example, the last log file would be stored in /var/log/
	XFree86.0.log, the next /var/log/XFree86.9.log, so on and so forth.

/var/log/syslog
	The 'system' log file. The contents of this file is managed via the
	syslogd daemon which more often than not takes care of all log
	manipulation on most systems.
