/var/lock
	Many programs follow a convention to create a lock file in /var/lock to
	indicate that they are using a particular device or file. This directory
	holds those lock files (for some devices) and hopefully other programs
	will notice the lock file and won't attempt to use the device or file.

	Lock files should be stored within the /var/lock directory structure.
	Lock files for devices and other resources shared by multiple
	applications, such as the serial device lock files that were originally
	found in either /usr/spool/locks or /usr/spool/uucp, must now be stored
	in /var/lock. The naming convention which must be used is LCK.. followed
	by the base name of the device file. For example, to lock /dev/ttyS0 the
	file LCK..ttyS0 would be created. The format used for the contents of
	such lock files must be the HDB UUCP lock file format. The HDB format is
	to store the process identifier (PID) as a ten byte ASCII decimal number,
	with a trailing newline. For example, if process 1230 holds a lock file,
	it would contain the eleven characters: space, space, space, space,
	space, space, one, two, three, zero, and newline.
