/var/opt
    Variable data of the program packages in /opt must be installed in /var/
    opt/'package-name', where 'package-name' is the name of the subtree in /
    opt where the static data from an add-on software package is stored,
    except where superceded by another file in /etc. No structure is imposed
    on the internal arrangement of /var/opt/'package-name'.
