/var/spool
    Holds spool files, for instance for mail, news, and printing (lpd) and
    other queued work. Spool files store data to be processed after the job
    currently occupying a device is finished or the appropriate cron job is
    started. Each different spool has its own subdirectory below /var/spool,
    e.g., the cron tables are stored in /var/spool/cron/crontabs.
