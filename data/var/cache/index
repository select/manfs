/var/cache
    Is intended for cached data from applications. Such data is locally
    generated as a result of time-consuming I/O or calculation. This data can
    generally be regenerated or be restored. Unlike /var/spool, files here
    can be deleted without data loss. This data remains valid between
    invocations of the application and rebooting of the system. The existence
    of a separate directory for cached data allows system administrators to
    set different disk and backup policies from other directories in /var.

/var/cache/fonts
    Locally-generated fonts. In particular, all of the fonts which are
    automatically generated by mktexpk must be located in appropriately-named
    subdirectories of /var/cache/ fonts.

/var/cache/man
    A cache for man pages that are formatted on demand. The source for manual
    pages is usually stored in /usr/share/man/; some manual pages might come
    with a pre-formatted version, which is stored in /usr/share/man/cat*
    (this is fairly rare now). Other manual pages need to be formatted when
    they are first viewed; the formatted version is then stored in /var/man
    so that the next person to view the same page won't have to wait for it
    to be formatted (/var/catman is often cleaned in the same way temporary
    directories are cleaned).

/var/cache/'package-name'
    Package specific cache data.

/var/cache/www
    WWW proxy or cache data.

/var/crash
    This directory will eventually hold system crash dumps. Currently, system
    crash dumps are not supported under Linux. However, development is
    already complete and is awaiting unification into the Linux kernel.
