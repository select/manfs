/var/lib
	Holds dynamic data libraries/files like the rpm/dpkg database and game
	scores. Furthermore, this hierarchy holds state information pertaining to
	an application or the system. State information is data that programs
	modify while they run, and that pertains to one specific host. Users
	shouldn't ever need to modify files in /var/lib to configure a package's
	operation. State information is generally used to preserve the condition
	of an application (or a group of inter-related applications) between
	invocations and between different instances of the same application. An
	application (or a group of inter-related applications) use a subdirectory
	of /var/lib for their data. There is one subdirectory, /var/lib/misc,
	which is intended for state files that don't need a subdirectory; the
	other subdirectories should only be present if the application in
	question is included in the distribution. /var/lib/'name' is the location
	that must be used for all distribution packaging support. Different
	distributions may use different names, of course.
