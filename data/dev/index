1.5. /dev

/dev is the location of special or device files. It is a very interesting
directory that highlights one important aspect of the Linux filesystem -
everything is a file or a directory. Look through this directory and you
should hopefully see hda1, hda2 etc.... which represent the various
partitions on the first master drive of the system. /dev/cdrom and /dev/fd0
represent your CD-ROM drive and your floppy drive. This may seem strange but
it will make sense if you compare the characteristics of files to that of
your hardware. Both can be read from and written to. Take /dev/dsp, for
instance. This file represents your speaker device. Any data written to this
file will be re-directed to your speaker. If you try 'cat /boot/vmlinuz > /
dev/dsp' (on a properly configured system) you should hear some sound on the
speaker. That's the sound of your kernel! A file sent to /dev/lp0 gets
printed. Sending data to and reading from /dev/ttyS0 will allow you to
communicate with a device attached there - for instance, your modem.

The majority of devices are either block or character devices; however other
types of devices exist and can be created. In general, 'block devices' are
devices that store or hold data, 'character devices' can be thought of as
devices that transmit or transfer data. For example, diskette drives, hard
drives and CD-ROM drives are all block devices while serial ports, mice and
parallel printer ports are all character devices. There is a naming scheme of
sorts but in the vast majority of cases these are completely illogical.

Some common device files as well as their equivalent counterparts under
Windows that you may wish to remember are:

/dev/ttyS0 (First communications port, COM1)
     First serial port (mice, modems).

/dev/psaux (PS/2)
     PS/2 mouse connection (mice, keyboards).

/dev/lp0 (First printer port, LPT1)
     First parallel port (printers, scanners, etc).

/dev/dsp (First audio device)
     The name DSP comes from the term digital signal processor, a specialized
    processor chip optimized for digital signal analysis. Sound cards may use
    a dedicated DSP chip, or may implement the functions with a number of
    discrete devices. Other terms that may be used for this device are
    digitized voice and PCM.

/dev/usb (USB Devices)
     This subdirectory contains most of the USB device nodes. Device name
    allocations are fairly simplistic so no elaboration is be necessary.

/dev/sda (C:\, SCSI device)
     First SCSI device (HDD, Memory Sticks, external mass storage devices
    such as CD-ROM drives on laptops, etc).

/dev/scd (D:\, SCSI CD-ROM device)
     First SCSI CD-ROM device.

/dev/js0 (Standard gameport joystick)
     First joystick device.


Devices are defined by type, such as 'block' or 'character', and 'major' and
'minor' number. The major number is used to categorize a device and the minor
number is used to identify a specific device type. For example, all IDE
device connected to the primary controller have a major number of 3. Master
and slave devices, as well as individual partitions are further defined by
the use of minor numbers. These are the two numbers precede the date in the
following display:

The major number for both hda and hdb devices is 3. Of course, the minor
number changes for each specific partition. The definition of each major
number category can be examined by looking at the contents of the /usr/src/
linux/include/linux/major.h file. The devices.txt also documents major and
minor numbers. It is located in the /usr/src/linux/Documentation directory.
This file defines the major numbers. Almost all files devices are created by
default at the install time. However, you can always create a device using
the mknod command or the MAKEDEV script which is located in the /dev
directory itself. Devices can be created with this utility by supplying the
device to be created, the device type (block or character) and the major and
minor numbers. For example, let's say you have accidentally deleted /dev/
ttyS0 (COM1 under Windows), it can be recreated using the following command

# mknod ttyS0 c 4 64

For those of us who are rather lazy you can simply run the MAKEDEV script as
such

# MAKEDEV *

which will create all devices known.

If is possible that /dev may also contain a MAKEDEV.local for the creation of
any local device files.

In general and as required by the FSSTND, MAKEDEV will have provisions for
creating any device that may be found on the system, not just those that a
particular implementation installs.

For those of you who are wondering why Linux is using such a primitive system
to reference devices its because we haven't been able to devise a
sufficiently sophisticated mechanism which provides enough advantages over
the current system in order to achieve widespread adoption.

To date (as of kernel version 2.4), the best attempt has been made by Richard
Gooch of the CSIRO. It's called devfsd and has been a part of the kernel for
a number of years now. It has been sanctioned by the kernel developers and
Linus himself and details of its implementation can be found at /usr/src/
linux/Documentation/filesystems/devfs/README. Below is an excerpt from this
document.

Devfs is an alternative to "real" character and block special devices on your
root filesystem. Kernel device drivers can register devices by name rather
than major and minor numbers. These devices will appear in devfs
automatically, with whatever default ownership and protection the driver
specified. A daemon (devfsd) can be used to override these defaults. Devfs
has been in the kernel since 2.3.46.

NOTE that devfs is entirely optional. If you prefer the old disc-based device
nodes, then simply leave CONFIG_DEVFS_FS=n (the default). In this case,
nothing will change. ALSO NOTE that if you do enable devfs, the defaults are
such that full compatibility is maintained with the old devices names.

There are two aspects to devfs: one is the underlying device namespace, which
is a namespace just like any mounted filesystem. The other aspect is the
filesystem code which provides a view of the device namespace. The reason I
make a distinction is because devfs can be mounted many times, with each
mount showing the same device namespace. Changes made are global to all
mounted devfs filesystems. Also, because the devfs namespace exists without
any devfs mounts, you can easily mount the root filesystem by referring to an
entry in the devfs namespace.

The cost of devfs is a small increase in kernel code size and memory usage.
About 7 pages of code (some of that in __init sections) and 72 bytes for each
entry in the namespace. A modest system has only a couple of hundred device
entries, so this costs a few more pages. Compare this with the suggestion to
put /dev on a ramdisc.

On a typical machine, the cost is under 0.2 percent. On a modest system with
64 MBytes of RAM, the cost is under 0.1 percent. The accusations of
"bloatware" levelled at devfs are not justified.

As of kernel version 2.6, devfs has been marked obsolete and has now been
replaced by udev. A system very similar (at least from a the end user's point
of view) to devfs but which works entirely in userspace. An overview of udev
